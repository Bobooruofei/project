Lion roars are the loudest of any other big cat. Their roars can reach 114 decibels (the same loudness as a chainsaw) and can be heard from as far as five miles away. This is because lions have a square and flat-shaped voice box, whereas other big cats in the pack have a triangle-shaped voice box. Translation: better airflow means a louder roar with less effort!
